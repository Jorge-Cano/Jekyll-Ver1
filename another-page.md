## Blog and Daily Thoughts..My very own 'Thought Balloon'.

Wednesday November 29th, 2017

I've been coding for about 2 years.
To be fair the first year was lingering around, and learning
small chunks of code blocks and attempting to run commands
on the terminal and command line, before understanding that the
bulk of coding is learning during a project build. Being resourceful
is the key, and coding daily. It's extremely tough to be great if you
take long breaks from exercises. The best part if that it's an expression
of your thoughts and a fingerprint of your past and present. You can leave your traces, and people can find those bread crumbs. Ultimately my goal over the next year is to make as many commits to my own projects while pushing code fixes and bugs to collaborative software tools through out open source.

Within Sales Operations at Dropoff, I have the opportunity to work on MySQL since sourcing the NPI Hippaspace DB. So that's encouraging practice and I've also been working on a live streaming chat application named 'Pusher'. It works for node, ruby and python. My other projects include Selenium-Webdriver and rebuilding an Express API, Sinatra Albums and Songs application. May try something in Ruby but that's a lot of what I'll be finishing over this winter break to conclude diving back into coding consistently.
