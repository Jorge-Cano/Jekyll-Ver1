_Yay you made it.. that was a breeze._

## Blog and Daily Thoughts..My very own 'Thought Balloon'.

**Sunday December 10th, 2017**

_What are your current the current coding projects you're involved in?_
I'm engaged in building an Express, Mongo DB Star Wars App; Working on minimizing daily resources on Google Search/Maps for leads at my company via a scripting project using Python, Mechanize and Beautiful Soup (my aim is to automate the entire lead sourcing that's currently being done OR at least part of it), and then there's a coin flip between my 'Pusher' project that using websockets for chat & Selenium Webdriver for automated testing (which I should technically use for the webscraping but I got on this tutorial via youtube and can turn back now.)

_What is the word of the year for you?_
'Subsequent', yea I've been stuck on this word lately. If there was a close second I would have to go with 'Recursion'.

_What are you goals for 2018?_
Automate more tasks and not just at work but in my routine. I need to build and app that just displays everything I need read up on whether it be news, emails or docs.. I need 1 page, 1 single pane. My other goal is to reach peak physical shape.

I want to look good but really spending the time on conditioning and endurance will be at the top.

Family & Travel. I want to set aside more time this coming year to appreciate and show my immediate family how much they mean to me, whether it's just a care package, a hug or a trip that can show my appreciation.

Hopefully a pet fits into my lifestyle by the end of 2018. It would be nice to come home to a small dog or cat.

That's all for now. - Jorge

I've been coding for about 2 years now.
To be fair the first year was lingering around, and learning
small chunks of code blocks and attempting to run commands
on the terminal and command line, before understanding that the
bulk of coding is learning during a project build. Being resourceful
is the key, and also making time push code daily. It's extremely tough to be great if you take long breaks from exercises. The best part if that it's an expression of your thoughts and a fingerprint of your past and present. You can leave your traces, and people can find those bread crumbs. Ultimately my goal over the next year is to make as many commits to my own projects while pushing code fixes and bugs to collaborative software tools through out open source.

Within Sales Operations at Dropoff, I have the opportunity to work on MySQL since sourcing the NPI Hippaspace DB. So that's encouraging practice and I've also been working on a live streaming chat application named 'Pusher'. It works for node, ruby and python. My other projects include Selenium-Webdriver for testing and webscraping, rebuilding an API in Express, and finally a Frank Sinatra tribute app to his catalog of albums and songs. I may try to squeeze in a project utilizing a functional language like Scala or Haskell before the years end.
